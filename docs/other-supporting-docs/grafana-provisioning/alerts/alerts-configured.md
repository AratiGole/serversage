**Alert Definitions**

A key component of this repository is the inclusion of alert definitions within a JSON file. This file contains the following alerts:

1.  Node Down
2.  High CPU Utilization
3.  High System Load
4.  High Memory Usage
5.  PostgreSQL Database Down

**Grafana Provisioning**

* **PostgreSQL Exporter:** For PostgreSQL database-specific metrics.
